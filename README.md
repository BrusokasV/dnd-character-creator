# D&D character creator
-----------------------

This is a python project I have created as my final project for the programming course at GIC (Glasgow International College) in 2023.

This project aims to emulate character creation process for the 4th edition of Dungeons & Dragons. It simplifies and abstracts the process, and does not offer as much variety for customisation as the actual character creation process in the aforementioned system.

Nevertheless, it serves as a proof of concept and offers a way to visualise the process with a system of overlayed sprites, which I created myself using Blender 3D, based on this model: https://www.turbosquid.com/de/3d-models/human-male/370689
