Heirs to an ancient, infernal bloodline, tieflings
are descended from human nobles who bargained with 
dark powers, and long ago their empire subjugated 
half the world. But the empire was cast down into ruin, 
and tieflings were left to make their own way in a world 
that often fears and resents them.
