   Welcome to a Character Creator app, inspired by Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition!
   Here you can create you dream character, albeit with many limitations, unlike in real D&D games.
   You can choose name for your character, their race, class and weapon (dependent on class). Furthermore, you can generate ability scores with classic method used in D&D - 4d6d1, "Roll 4d6, drop lowest".
   Please refer to window above if you want to load in an existing character or save the one you created. Please note, that there cannot be two characters sharing a name. Your class abilities, hit points and armor class are displayed to the left.
